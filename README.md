# Spring Boot + MongoDB Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate MongoDB with Spring Boot, covering a wide range of data access patterns‚Äîfrom
simple CRUD to advanced aggregation pipelines. It‚Äôs designed as a learning repository, providing both code samples and
tests to help you master MongoDB usage in a Spring ecosystem.

## üåü Topics Covered

- CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Pagination & Sorting via Spring Data Pageable
- Derived Query Methods: And, Or, In, Like, TopN
- Custom @Query methods with raw JSON (regex, text search)
- Aggregation Pipelines using MongoTemplate ($unwind, $group, $lookup)
- DBRef & Joins via $lookup
- Transient Fields & computed properties
- Docker Compose for MongoDB setup
- Integration Testing: @DataMongoTest + Testcontainers

## Prerequisites

- Java17 or higher
- Maven (or Gradle)
- Docker (for MongoDB)
- Postman (optional, for API testing)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/spring-boot-with-mongodb.git
    cd spring-boot-with-mongodb
    ```
2. Start MongoDB via Docker Compose
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
3. Build & run the application
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

The REST API will be available at http://localhost:8888/api/v1/students

## üóÑÔ∏è Configuration

- MongoDB URI: configured in src/main/resources/application.yml
   ```yaml
   spring:
    data:
      mongodb:
        uri: mongodb://localhost:27017/studentdb
   ```
- Docker Compose definition in docker-compose.yml launches a mongo:latest container.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement native text-search endpoint (GET /text?term=...) using MongoDB text index
- [ ] Create aggregation pipeline endpoints:
    - [ ] GET /agg/avg-marks (average marks per course)
    - [ ] GET /agg/count-by-dept (student count by department)
    - [ ] GET /lookup (join students with departments)
- [ ] Define and apply MongoDB indexes (e.g., text, compound) in code or migrations
